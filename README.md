Basic starting point templates for shapemaster kicks

Tempo range: 72 bpm to 179 bpm

(The main thing is that this saves the step where you have to calculate the millisecond length for the envelope.)

* 1st envelope: Pitch drop. Suggested usage: Try connecting this one to the exponential FM input on a Palm Loop and turn the exp fm amount up to taste. Turn the octave knob down 2 or 3 octaves. You are expected to adjust the points and curvature to fine-tune the character.
* 2nd envelope: Amplitude. Run the sine output through the built-in vca or use the cv to control a vca of your choice. Once again, you are expected to adjust the location of the points and the curvature.
* 3rd envelope: Trigger. Use for sync/reset on the vco.
* 4th through 8th envelopes: They were extra so rather than leave them unused I went ahead and put in the ms length for various 8-bar riser-type envelopes. Use on things like pitch, detune, fm-amount, low-pass, hi-pass, reverb or delay send...
